Written Report

The analyses undertaken in this report assess the standardised test results from an local government area with a particular
focus on math and reading scores specific to government and independent schools in the area. 
The data has been aggregated to identify trends in school performance incl:
    
   * High-level snapshot of the Local Government Area Schools focusing on the these datapoints: 
        Number of schools, total students, budget, average math and reading scores of each student, percentage of students 
        passing math, and a calculation of the overall pass rate for each student which is based on a combination  
        of their math and reading scores pass rate.
                                                                
    * School level analysis using the datapoints noted above and including School Type and Per Student Budget. 
        The analysis also includes: 
           * Identifying the five highest-performing schools and lowest-performing schools in the area.
           * The Math and Reading scores for each school across student years from year level 9 to 12                        
           * Average school spend per child vs math, reading and overall pass rate outcomes
           * Average school size vs math, reading and overall pass rate outcomes
           * School type vs math, reading and overall pass rate outcomes
                                                          

From the analyses undertaken we can make the following conclusions
   * Conclusion 1 - On average a school that spends between $585 - $630 achieve better math and reading scores, 
                    and have a higher overall pass rate.

   * Conclusion 2 - On average schools with less than a 1000 students achieve a better pass rate for math and reading.

   * Conclusion 3 - On average Independent Schools deliver scores and pass rates when compared to Government schools.
